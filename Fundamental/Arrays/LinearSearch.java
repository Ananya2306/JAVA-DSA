public class LinearSearch {
    /*
You have been given a random integer array/list(ARR) of size N, and an integer X. 
You need to search for the integer X in the given array/list using 'Linear Search'.
You have been required to return the index at which X is present in the array/list. 
If X has multiple occurrences in the array/list, 
then you need to return the index at which the first occurrence of X would be encountered. 
In case X is not present in the array/list, then return -1.

'Linear search' is a method for finding an element within an array/list. 
It sequentially checks each element of the array/list until a match is found or the whole array/list has been searched.'
Sample Input 1:
7
2 13 4 1 3 6 28
3
Sample Output 1:
4
You have been given an empty array(ARR) and its size N. 
The only input taken from the user will be N and you need not worry about the array.

Your task is to populate the array using the integer values 
in the range 1 to N(both inclusive) in the order - 1,3,5,.......,6,4,2.
You need not print the array. You only need to populate it.
Sample Input 1 :
1
6
Sample Output 1 :
1 3 5 6 4 2
Explanation of Sample Input 1 :
Since the value of N is 6, the number will be stored in the array in such a fashion that 1 will appear at 0th index, then 2 at the last index, in a similar fashion 3 is stored at index 1. Hence the array becomes 1 3 5 6 4 2.
